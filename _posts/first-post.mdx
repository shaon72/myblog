<div>
  Let's dive straight into a fairly well known and simple topic: the knapsack problem.
  The problem states:<br/><br/>

  <div className="announce">
  
  <i>"Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible."</i>
  
  </div>

  Now imagine a single box of weight W and you have got multiple smaller boxes each having some money. You need to place those smaller boxes in the single big box as long as the sum of weights of all those small boxes does not 
  exceed the weight of the big box while also maximising the amount of money kept in them.
  <br/>
  We're going to solve this using recursion first of all. You might have heard about recursion from the famous Fibonacci problem. All we need to do is to break up the problem into smaller parts.
  <div>
  
  The maximum value obtained from ‘N’ items is the max of the following two values:

  <ul>
    <li>Maximum value obtained by N-1 items and W weight (excluding nth item)</li>
    <li>Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by N-1 items and (W – weight of the Nth item) [including Nth item].</li>
    
  </ul>
  If the weight of the ‘Nth‘ item is greater than ‘W’, then the Nth item cannot be included and Case 1 is the only possibility.
  <br/>
  </div>

  <div className="codeblock">
  ```
  int knapSack(int W, int wt[], int val[], int n)
  {     
      // Base Case
      if (n == 0 || W == 0) {
          return 0;
      }

      // If weight of the nth item is more than Knapsack capacity W, then
      // this item cannot be included in the optimal solution
      if (wt[n - 1] > W)
          return knapSack(W, wt, val, n - 1);

      // Return the maximum of two cases:
      // (1) nth item included
      // (2) not included
      else
          return max(
              val[n - 1]
                  + knapSack(W - wt[n - 1], wt, val, n - 1),
              knapSack(W, wt, val, n - 1));
  }
  ```
  </div>

    The recursive approach calculates the same subproblems multiple times which increases the time and space complexity. This can be optimised by using dynamic programming.
    <br/>
    
    
    Consider the same cases as mentioned in the recursive approach.
    In a DP[][] table let’s consider all the possible weights from ‘1’ to ‘W’ as the columns and the element that can be kept as rows. 

    The state DP[i][j] will denote the maximum value of ‘j-weight’ considering all values from ‘1 to ith‘. So if we consider ‘wi‘ (weight in ‘ith‘ row) we can fill it in all columns which have ‘weight values > wi‘. Now two possibilities can take place: 
    <ul>
      <li>Fill ‘wi‘ in the given column.</li> 
      <li>Do not fill ‘wi‘ in the given column.</li> 
    </ul>
    Now we have to take a maximum of these two possibilities, 
    Formally if we do not fill the ‘ith‘ weight in the ‘jth‘ column then the DP[i][j] state will be the same as DP[i-1][j] 
    But if we fill the weight, DP[i][j] will be equal to the value of (‘wi‘+ value of the column weighing ‘j-wi’) in the previous row. 
    So we take the maximum of these two possibilities to fill the current state.

    <div className="codeblock">
    ```
    int knapSack(int W, int wt[], int val[], int n)
    {
        int i, w;
        vector<vector<int> > K(n + 1, vector<int>(W + 1));

        // Build table K[][] in bottom up manner
        for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
                if (i == 0 || w == 0)
                    K[i][w] = 0;
                else if (wt[i - 1] <= w)
                    K[i][w] = max(val[i - 1]
                                      + K[i - 1][w - wt[i - 1]],
                                  K[i - 1][w]);
                else
                    K[i][w] = K[i - 1][w];
            }
        }
        return K[n][W];
    }
    ```

    I hope y'all enjoyed reading that. If there are more optimised ways of solving this, please let me know in the comments.
